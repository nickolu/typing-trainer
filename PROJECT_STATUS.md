---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Typing Experience - COMPLETED

### Feature 1: Typing Test ✅
**Status:** Fully implemented and tested

**Functionality:**
- ✅ 30-second timed typing test with countdown timer
- ✅ 150 words per test (automatically repeated from 50 static test contents)
- ✅ Real-time character-by-character visual feedback
- ✅ Color-coded states:
  - **Pending words**: Gray/muted
  - **Current word**: White with blue cursor
  - **Typed characters**: Blue
  - **Incorrect characters**: Red with background
  - **Completed correct words**: Green (no strikethrough)
  - **Completed incorrect words**: Red (no strikethrough)
- ✅ Tab key to skip to next word (marks current as incomplete/incorrect)
- ✅ Backspace to fix mistakes
- ✅ Space bar to complete words
- ✅ Auto-scroll to keep current word centered in view
- ✅ Fixed-height scrolling container (prevents page jumping)
- ✅ Clear "Start Test" button modal (prevents accidental starts)

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location:** `components/typing-test/`
- **State Management:** Zustand store (`store/test-store.ts`)
- **Key Components:**
  - `TypingTest.tsx` - Main container with keyboard handling
  - `TestDisplay.tsx` - Word grid with auto-scroll
  - `TestTimer.tsx` - Countdown timer
  - `WordDisplay.tsx` - Individual word with character-level feedback

### Feature 2: Test Results ✅
**Status:** Fully implemented with accurate calculations

**Functionality:**
- ✅ **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Only counts correctly typed words
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Percentage based on words actually typed (not total available)
- ✅ **Words Typed**: Total number of words user typed
- ✅ **Correct Words**: Number of perfectly typed words
- ✅ **Mistakes**: Number of words typed incorrectly (not blank/untyped words)
- ✅ Results automatically saved to IndexedDB
- ✅ "Try Same Test Again" button
- ✅ "New Test" button (loads random test)

**Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
// WPM: Only correct words count toward speed
WPM = (correct_chars / 5) / (duration_seconds / 60)

// Accuracy: Based on what you typed, not what was available
Accuracy = (correct_words / words_typed) * 100
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location:** `components/results/`
- **Database:** IndexedDB via Dexie (`lib/db/`)
- **Calculations:** `lib/test-engine/calculations.ts`
- **Key Components:**
  - `ResultsView.tsx` - Results container
  - `StatsCard.tsx` - WPM/Accuracy cards

---

  - 15 famous quotes
  - 15 prose/literature excerpts
  - 10 technical writing samples
  - 10 common English phrases
- ✅ Auto-repeat logic to generate 150 words per test
- ✅ Random test selection

### State Management
- ✅ Zustand store with complete test lifecycle
- ✅ In-memory keystroke tracking (for future analytics)
- ✅ Accurate WPM and accuracy calculations

### UI/UX
- ✅ Dark VSCode-inspired theme
- ✅ Custom Tailwind color palette

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Local-First:** IndexedDB as primary storage, cloud sync optional
2. **Performance:** In-memory calculations, minimal DB writes
3. **Accuracy:** WPM only counts correct words, accuracy based on typed words
4. **UX:** Smooth scrolling, clear visual feedback, keyboard-first
5. **Future-Ready:** DB schema supports multi-user, keystroke data saved for analytics
