## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key (optional, only needed for AI-generated content)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd typing-trainer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env.local file (optional, for AI features)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env.local

## How It Works

### Basic Test Flow
1. Choose test duration (15s, 30s, 60s, or 2min)
2. Optionally enable AI content or select a content style
3. Start typing to begin the test
4. Timer counts down while you type
5. Real-time feedback shows correct/incorrect characters
6. Test auto-completes when timer expires
7. View detailed results with analytics
8. Generate targeted practice or start a new test

### Targeted Practice Flow
1. Complete a test and view results
2. Review sequence analysis and mistake analysis
3. Click "Generate Targeted Practice"
4. Select up to 20 sequences/words to focus on
5. AI generates custom content with high frequency of selected items
6. Practice mode shows banner with targets
7. Optional highlighting shows practice targets during typing
8. Complete practice test and see improvement

### Data Storage
- **Local-first**: All test results stored in IndexedDB
- **No cloud dependency**: Works completely offline
- **Privacy-focused**: Data never leaves your device
- **Persistent**: Data saved across browser sessions
- **Future-ready**: Schema designed for optional cloud sync

## Content Options

### Static Content (50 built-in tests)
- **Quotes** (15): Famous quotes from notable figures
- **Prose** (15): Literary excerpts and opening lines
- **Technical** (10): Programming and tech writing
- **Common** (10): Common English phrases

### AI-Generated Content (requires API key)
- **Prose**: Literary-style text
- **Quotes**: Inspirational quote-style text
- **Technical**: Programming/tech documentation style
- **Common**: Everyday conversational language
- **Custom**: Use your own prompts for specific topics

## Visual Feedback

### Color Coding
- **Pending words**: Dim gray
- **Current word**: Bright white with smooth animated cursor
- **Correct characters**: Dimmed after typing
- **Incorrect characters**: Red background
- **Completed correct**: Green
- **Completed incorrect**: Red
- **Practice highlights**: Purple background (toggleable)

### Keyboard Controls
- **Regular typing**: Type normally to input text
- **Space**: Complete current word and move to next
- **Backspace**: Delete last character (or disabled in No-Corrections Mode)
- **Tab**: Skip to next word (marks current as incomplete)

## Design Decisions

### Local-First Architecture
- **IndexedDB as primary storage** - All data stored locally in your browser
- **No cloud dependency** - Works completely offline
- **Privacy-focused** - Data never leaves your device
- **Future-ready** - Schema designed for optional cloud sync
- **Multi-user capable** - Database schema supports multiple users (future)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Precise timing**: `performance.now()` for microsecond-accurate keystroke tracking
- **In-memory calculations**: WPM and accuracy computed during test
- **Minimal DB writes**: Only final results saved to database
- **Efficient rendering**: `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Smart highlighting**: Character-level highlighting with optimized search
- **Smooth cursor**: CSS transitions for 60fps cursor movement
- **ResizeObserver**: Responsive cursor positioning without layout thrashing

### UI/UX Philosophy
- **Dark theme** inspired by VSCode and modern IDEs
- **Keyboard-first** navigation - minimal mouse usage required
- **Immediate feedback** - Real-time visual feedback as you type
- **Minimal, flat design** - Focus on content, not chrome
- **High contrast** - Accessibility-focused color choices
- **Monospace font** (JetBrains Mono) for test content consistency
- **Auto-scroll** - Current word always visible
- **Progressive enhancement** - Static content works, AI is optional

### Technical Architecture
- **Type-safe**: TypeScript strict mode throughout
- **Component-driven**: Small, focused, reusable components
- **State management**: Zustand for predictable state updates
- **Server-side AI**: API keys never exposed to client
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Development

### Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

### Development Tips
- Hot reload enabled - changes appear instantly
- TypeScript strict mode catches errors early
- ESLint configured with Next.js best practices
- Zustand DevTools available in browser console
- IndexedDB can be inspected in browser DevTools

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:

### Analytics & Insights

- Custom word lists import
- Timed burst mode (type as much as possible)

### Social Features
- Optional cloud sync for multi-device access
- Anonymous leaderboards (opt-in)
- Challenge friends with specific tests
- Share test results

### Advanced Analytics
- Visual keyboard heatmap
- Finger-specific statistics
- Real-time WPM display during test
